## General Info
Solving the Tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle by implementing a recursive algorithm

>The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three towers and a number of discs (3 in this puzzle)
 of different sizes, which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with the discs in a neat stack in ascending order 
 of size on one tower (first tower in this puzzle), the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

>The purpose of this puzzle is to move the discs one by one from the first tower to the last tower knowing the only
 condition is that smaller disc will always be on top of the bigger disc.
 
>In case of 3 discs we can solve the puzzle in minimum ((2 to the power 3) - 1 = 7) 7 movements.
